                My name is Logan Hanisak, I am a soon-to-be graduate from NJIT's IT program.  I have roughly a 3.9 GPA and
                am slated to graduate Summa Cum Laude. I took the Web App Dev- elopment specialization of the IT program and
                furthermore took classes focusing on mobile app development.  Additionally, I have my Associate's in Computer
                Science so I have a strong background in technology and a wide range of programming skills to fall back on.
                In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, D&D, reading fiction, and various forms of writing.

                    Git is the industry standard in terms of version control software. Although it can be tricky  to learn,
                    once mastered it makes collaboration with a team on a project so much easier than before. Git can automatically
                    track changes made by each team member and detect conflicts in order to prevent the whole project from
                    being overwritten every time someone sends their changes to the remote repository. This is in addition
                    to a full suite of other useful functions as well as a web-based file hosting system called GitHub.

                    GitHub is the online component of Git. Primarily used to host repositories in a convenient place, it
                    serves as the hub for all of your work.  It can do more than simply store and show off your work, however,
                    as it has almost as many features as Git and can be considered a GUI version of such in a pinch. GitHub
                    also makes project management a breeze, due to it automatically saving the records of everyone's submitted
                    work and enabling several forms of access control to prevent any random shmuck from ruining your whole
                    project.

                    Developed by JetBrains, WebStorm is a very powerful and feature-complete IDE for all your programming
                    needs.  It supports a wide array of programming languages, has several options for VCS integration,
                    and has dozens of handy features to make your life so much easier.  It appears to be built off of the
                    IntelliJ platform, which is used in other IDEs such as Android Studo.  All things considered, WebStorm
                    should be your go-to IDE for web development and I wish I could afford a full license for it.

                <span class="matter">
                    HTML 5 is the latest revision of the decades-old HTML framework.  Designed to make powerful and responsive
                    webpages, HTML 5 should be the skeleton of any good website.  Having added much more functionality
                    when compared to previous versions it becomes clear that there has never been more power and control
                    given to web developers then there is now.  The only downside is some of the new features added aren't
                    fully supported on certain web browsers--but due to said features, you can very easily tell those users
                    to go download Chrome or FireFox!

                <span class="matter">
                    If HTML 5 is the skeleton of every good webpage, then CSS 3 is the skin of good webpages.  Just like
                    with HTML 5, CSS 3 puts an unprecedented level of control and power into the hands of web designers.
                    CSS 3 brings dozens of new features to the table to make webpages much more sleek and responsive than
                    ever before.  CSS 3 faces the same problem as HTML 5, in that some browsers don't yet fully support all
                    of the new features added in by CSS 3.

                    If CSS 3 is the skin of good webpages, then BootStrap is like getting plastic surgery.  BootStrap is
                    a CSS and HTML framework designed to make your pages look good in a hurry.  The individual components
                    and CSS files are distributed freely from their website and you can use as much or as little as you
                    want.  Sometimes all you need to get the job done is to take the BootStrap theme as a whole and retool
                    it to fit your needs.  The only real downside to using BootStrap is that your websites will look similar
                    to other BootStrap pages.

                    Linux is an open-source operating system with three main distributions: RedHat, Debian, and Ubuntu.
                    Many people consider Linux to be the industry standard when it comes to development environments for
                    programmers.  No fees whatsoever, a large and helpful community, a vast library of plugins and extensions
                    to further improve your experience, and a high degree of flexibility and compatibility to suit your needs.
                    Plus the mascot is a silly little penguin.  What's not to love?
