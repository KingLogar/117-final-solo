                My name is Logan Hanisak, I am a soon-to-be graduate from NJIT's IT program.  I have roughly a 3.9 GPA and
                am slated to graduate Summa Cum Laude. I took the Web App Dev- elopment specialization of the IT program and
                furthermore took classes focusing on mobile app development.  Additionally, I have my Associate's in Computer
                Science so I have a strong background in technology and a wide range of programming skills to fall back on.
                In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, D&D, reading fiction, and various forms of writing.

                    Git is the industry standard in terms of version control software. Although it can be tricky  to learn,
                    once mastered it makes collaboration with a team on a project so much easier than before. Git can automatically
                    track changes made by each team member and detect conflicts in order to prevent the whole project from
                    being overwritten every time someone sends their changes to the remote repository. This is in addition
                    to a full suite of other useful functions as well as a web-based file hosting system called GitHub.

                    GitHub is the online component of Git. Primarily used to host repositories in a convenient place, it
                    serves as the hub for all of your work.  It can do more than simply store and show off your work, however,
                    as it has almost as many features as Git and can be considered a GUI version of such in a pinch. GitHub
                    also makes project management a breeze, due to it automatically saving the records of everyone's submitted
                    work and enabling several forms of access control to prevent any random shmuck from ruining your whole
                    project.
