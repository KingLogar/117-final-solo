                My name is Logan Hanisak, I am a soon-to-be graduate from NJIT's IT program.  I have roughly a 3.9 GPA and
                am slated to graduate Summa Cum Laude. I took the Web App Dev- elopment specialization of the IT program and
                furthermore took classes focusing on mobile app development.  Additionally, I have my Associate's in Computer
                Science so I have a strong background in technology and a wide range of programming skills to fall back on.
                In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, D&D, reading fiction, and various forms of writing.
