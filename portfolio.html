                My name is Logan Hanisak, I am a soon-to-be graduate from NJIT's IT program.  I have roughly a 3.9 GPA and
                am slated to graduate Summa Cum Laude. I took the Web App Dev- elopment specialization of the IT program and
                furthermore took classes focusing on mobile app development.  Additionally, I have my Associate's in Computer
                Science so I have a strong background in technology and a wide range of programming skills to fall back on.
                In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, D&D, reading fiction, and various forms of writing.

                    Git is the industry standard in terms of version control software. Although it can be tricky to learn,
                    once mastered it makes collaboration with a team on a project so much easier than before. Git can automatically
                    track changes made by each team member and detect conflicts in order to prevent the whole project from
                    being overwritten every time someone sends their changes to the remote repository. This is in addition
                    to a full suite of other useful functions and a web-based file hosting system called GitHub.
